Reproduction of the results mentioned in the paper "Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169)

The code used in this repo was adapted from Ilya Kostrikov's repository: https://github.com/ikostrikov/implicit_q_learning

The data used to run these experiments was obtained from **d4rl**.

Average return plots, loss plots and tensorboard log files from our reproduction of the experiments can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z4HHzVcW0MKEmprZj-aPRPTPlIxJ45aF?usp=sharing
